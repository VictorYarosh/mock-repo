Hello ,my name is Victor!
My impressions about learned materials , this materials very interesting . I want to become programmer and have just started teaching. This lesson was recommended to me by a friend of mine who is already working on front end developer.
I didn’t understand a bit in the second link ,where it visually shows commit ,but that’s normal since im just getting started.
